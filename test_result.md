# WorkBridge Application Testing Results

## Current Testing Session
**Date**: December 2024  
**Focus**: Project Posting Flow Verification  
**Objective**: Complete Phase 1 - Verify that newly posted projects appear correctly in the client's "My Projects" section

## User Problem Statement
Verify the end-to-end project posting flow works correctly and that posted projects are visible in the client dashboard's "My Projects" section.

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Guidelines:
1. Always test backend functionality first using `deep_testing_backend_v2` agent
2. Focus on API endpoints, data flow, and server functionality  
3. Verify authentication and role-based access
4. Test project store operations and data persistence

### Frontend Testing Guidelines:
1. Only test frontend after backend testing is complete
2. Requires explicit user permission via `ask_human` tool
3. Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for UI automation testing
4. Verify user interactions, navigation, and data display
