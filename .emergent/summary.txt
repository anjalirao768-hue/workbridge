The AI engineer successfully took over the WorkBridge project, addressing critical build and runtime issues, particularly around Next.js 15, JWT authentication, and Vercel deployment compatibility. Initial efforts focused on resolving a missing  dependency, then systematically fixing numerous TypeScript errors related to async route handlers and  calls, and crucially, migrating JWT handling from  to the Edge Runtime-compatible  library. After achieving a stable build, the engineer resolved a complex login redirect bug, which stemmed from supervisor configuration,  module resolution, and server-side JWT verification. The user then pivoted to significant UI/UX enhancements, leading to a complete redesign of the landing page with modern aesthetics and the creation of a detailed, legally structured Terms & Conditions page. Throughout, the engineer demonstrated iterative debugging, adaptability to changing user priorities, and a methodical approach to code refactoring and new feature implementation.
