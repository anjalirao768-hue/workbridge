The AI engineer successfully initiated the WorkBridge project, transitioning from placeholder pages to functional authentication and role-based dashboards. The initial phase focused on setting up the Supabase database, configuring environment variables, and implementing core user authentication (signup, login, logout). A significant portion of the work involved iterative debugging of authentication flows, specifically addressing stale JWT issues, async cookie handling in Next.js 15, and mismatches between API request bodies and the actual Supabase schema. The engineer also scaffolded UI for home, login, signup, and dedicated client, freelancer, and admin dashboards using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui. The most recent efforts revolve around resolving Vercel deployment build errors, including TypeScript type issues, ESLint warnings, and a crucial missing  dependency. The systematic approach to debugging and continuous testing, although sometimes encountering new issues, demonstrates a thorough development process.

The goal is to build WorkBridge, a lean freelance project collaboration and escrow platform similar to Upwork, prioritizing transparent project and payment flows.
**Core Goals:** Connect clients and freelancers, enable secure escrow payments, milestone tracking, dispute handling, provide an admin panel for oversight, ensure role-based access (client, freelancer, admin), include audit trail + transaction ledger, and prepare for Vercel deployment with Supabase.
**Tech Stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router, TypeScript), TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui, Supabase (database + storage), JWT Auth with cookies (role-aware), Resend for transactional emails, Vercel deployment.
**Current State (Implemented by AI):**
*   **Auth & Onboarding:** Signup/login/logout working, bcrypt hashed passwords, JWT in HttpOnly cookies, middleware protects  and  routes, role-based redirects.
*   **User Roles:**  table in Supabase stores uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), , , , , , , .
*   **Role-Based Dashboards (Scaffolded):**  renders a role-selection page with navigation to , , .
*   **Login/Signup UI:** Pages updated to use existing APIs with proper fields and role-based redirects.
*   **Dashboard Pages:** Basic placeholder dashboards created for , , .
*   **Middleware:** Updated to protect new dashboard routes and enforce admin access.
*   **Navigation:** Logout button on dashboards, Login here link on signup, Sign up here link on login.
**Next Steps (Originally outlined, but partially implemented/pending):** Database Schema Expansion (additional tables), Mock Escrow Provider, Webhook Handler, Disputes, KYC Mock Flow, Admin Panel advanced features, Ledger & Audit Trail, UI Polish, Deployment & Demo Prep.

<key_technical_concepts>
- Next.js 15 (App Router, API Routes)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication)
- TailwindCSS & shadcn/ui
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with HttpOnly Cookies
- TypeScript for type safety
- Middleware for authentication and authorization
-  for password hashing

<code_architecture>
The application follows a Next.js App Router architecture, with the primary source code residing in the  directory.
**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : Stores sensitive credentials like Supabase URLs/keys, JWT secret, Resend API key. **Changes**: Created and populated with user-provided keys.
-   : Next.js middleware for authentication and role-based authorization. Protects , , and  routes. **Changes**: Updated to protect the new  routes and ensure admin-only access for . Also fixed an issue where  was used in Edge Runtime, causing warnings.
-   : Centralized utility for handling user authentication, including getting the current user from cookies () and fetching fresh user data from the database (). **Changes**: Updated  for Next.js 15 async cookies and introduced  to avoid stale JWT role information.
-   : Initializes the Supabase client. **Changes**: Updated for server-side usage.
-   : Defines TypeScript interfaces for database entities (e.g., User, Project, Milestone, Escrow, Transaction, Dispute, AuditEvent). **Changes**: Added types for new tables and refined existing types to address  type errors.
-   : Frontend UI for user registration. **Changes**: Updated with shadcn/ui components, validation, and redirection logic. Added Login here link.
-   : Frontend UI for user login. **Changes**: Updated with shadcn/ui components, redirects based on user role. Added Sign up here link.
-   : Initial landing page after login/signup, presenting role selection and navigation options. **Changes**: Transformed into a role-selection and redirection page using Shadcn components, showing links to role-specific dashboards.
-   , , : New files creating the basic dashboard layouts with placeholder sections for each role. **Changes**: Created these files with scaffolded UI and sections like Projects, Escrows (Client), Available Projects, KYC (Freelancer), Users, Transactions (Admin).
-   : API endpoint to fetch current user information. **Changes**: Updated to use  to ensure up-to-date role information from the database.
-   : API endpoint to update a user's role. **Changes**: Fixed  type errors.
-   , , , etc.: API endpoints for project, milestone, escrow, transaction, dispute, and audit management. **Changes**: Fixed database schema mismatches (e.g., ,  columns), updated role checking to use fresh user data, and resolved  type errors.
-   , : Implement mock escrow functionality and webhook handling. **Changes**: Fixed TypeScript errors related to Supabase query results and  types in webhook processing.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Implement advanced features for Disputes (WB-9), KYC Mock Flow (WB-10).
- Develop full Admin Panel functionality (force actions, filter/search for WB-11).
- Implement full Ledger & Audit Trail for users and admins (WB-12).
- Apply comprehensive UI Polish (responsive on mobile, no horizontal scroll for WB-13).
- Complete Deployment & Demo Prep (Supabase migrations auto-run, seed demo data script, sandbox banner, script demo flows E2E for WB-14).
- Install the missing  dependency to resolve the latest build error.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently focused on resolving Vercel deployment errors reported by the user. These errors stemmed from various issues:
1.  **TypeScript  errors**: Addressed by adding explicit types in several API routes (, , , , ) and utility files (, , ). This involved refining Supabase query result typing and parameter types.
2.  **ESLint warnings**: Fixed issues like unused variables (e.g., ,  in , , ,  in ,  in dashboard pages,  in onboarding pages) and unescaped entities () in JSX (dashboard pages, home, login, onboarding pages).
3.  **Node.js API usage in Edge Runtime warnings**: Identified warnings related to  using  and , which are not supported in Vercel's Edge Runtime. The middleware was modified to handle this.

After making these extensive fixes across numerous files, a subsequent local build attempt failed with a  error. This indicates that despite the previous
